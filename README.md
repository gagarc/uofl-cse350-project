# Louie Learns Math
Hello and welcome to our Math Learning Tool, a project developed as part of the CSE 350 - Introduction to Software Engineering course at the University of Louisville. The primary goal of this project is to create an engaging, interactive platform primarily geared to help younger students learn and practice basic math operations, including: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This tool helps to provide various features designed to enhance the learning experience in a classroom trhough practice, quizzes, a built-in calculator, as well as lecture notes pertaining to each math operation

# Features

* Calculator:
    - A simple easy to use calculator which supports basic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* Lectures:
    - Provides notes for each math operation, helping the user to learn and understand the concepts behind addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* Practice:
    - Guided practice session for each math operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
    - Each practice quiz generates random math problems from each dataset.
    - Provides instant feedback indicating whether the answer submitted by the user was correct/incorrect.
* Quiz:
    - Allows users to test their knowledge across different math operations.
    - Tracks scores to help users measure their progress.


# Datasets
* the datasets used for this project stemmed from the addition dataset found online: https://huggingface.co/datasets/WforGodot/Addition

The addition dataset was based off of this dataset with minor tweaks, including reducing the overall size and complexity of the problems provided in the dataset. Since the project is primarily geared toward teaching younger kids math operations it was decided to reduce the complexity of the problems by opting to choose smaller numbers instead.
* The following datasets: subtraction, multiplication, and division were made by us, following the structure of the addition dataset adhearing to the same principles as well.
